 <p><h3><b>Height explained</b><h3></p>
h is the height above the selected ellipsoid. This height is obtained from GPS satellite observations but is not the gravity-related height above mean sea-level. The latter is usually meant in national mapping and levelling. 
<br> If H is a gravity-based height (orthometric height), it must be converted to an ellipsoidal height h = H + N before using the datum transformation formulas. The so-called geoid-separation N is the height of the local geoid above the ellipsoid at the point and is possibly negative. <br>The <a href="http://kartoweb.itc.nl/geometrics/Reference%20surfaces/refsurf.html">geoid</a> is a gravity surface approximating mean sea level (MSL). For the WGS84 ellipsoid the value of N, representing the height of the geoid relative to the ellipsoid, can vary between values of -106.99 m in the Indian Ocean to +60 m in the North Atlantic Ocean and +85.39 m near New Guinea.
